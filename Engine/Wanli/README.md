# Vulkan Graphic System

**!! Under Construction !!**

A collection of source code for multithread rendering in Next-Gen API: D3D12, Metal or Vulkan.

The engine is written in C++ 17 and, as such, has portable access to standard constructs for multithreading programming on cores. The engine also supports high-performance computing using general purpose GPU programming (GPGPU). SIMD code is also available using Intel Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE).
